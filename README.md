# pure_extensions

`pure_extensions` extends Pure CSS by adding additional interface elements and responsive
utility classes. It also removes shadows and rounded corners from forms.

## Install

Import directly into your Sass/SCSS project:

```scss
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaknite/pure_extensions/blob/master/dist/pure_extensions.css");
```

Link in your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaknite/pure_extensions/blob/master/dist/pure_extensions.min.css">
```

## Development

Clone this repository and then run `bin/prepare` from the project root.

Run `bin/build` to build a new distribution of the CSS.
